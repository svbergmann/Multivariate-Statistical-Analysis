# Chapter 7: Principal Component Analysis
```{r}
food <- read.csv(file = '../Data_csv/food.csv') # two points for knitting, one point for running it in the cell
food_names <- food$food_type
food <- food[, -1]
food2 <- sweep(x = food, MARGIN = 1, STATS = food$weight_grams, FUN = "/")
food2 <- food2[, -6]
```
```{r}
apply(X = food2, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd)
```
```{r}
food3 <- scale(food2)
```
```{r}
S <- cov(food3)
sum(diag(S))
```
```{r}
eig <- eigen(S)
eig$values
```
```{r}
cumsum(eig$values)
```
```{r}
cumsum(eig$values) / sum(eig$values)
```

First 3 account for 84% of the total variability.

Then $\mathcal{H}$ is the space spanned by the first 3 eigenvectors:
```{r}
eig$vectors[, 1:3]
```
```{r}
plot(1:6, eig$values)
```
```{r}
xi <- food3 %*% eig$vectors[, 1:3]
hist(xi[,1])
```
```{r}
food_names[which(xi[,1] <= -6)]
```
```{r}
food_names[which(xi[, 1]>=1.5)]
```
