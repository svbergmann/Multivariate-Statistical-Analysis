# Problem 1

The ``British_towns`` dataset contains distances between 48 British towns.

```{r}
towns <- read.csv(file = '../Data_csv/British_towns.csv')
towns <- subset(towns, select = -V1)
towns <- as.matrix(towns)
rownames(towns) <- colnames(towns)
```

## a)

Carry out a metric multidimensional scaling.

```{r}
mdsfit <- cmdscale(d = towns, k = 2, eig = T)
y <- mdsfit$points
```

From a plot of the eigenvalues,
does a two-dimensional solution appear reasonable?

```{r}
plot(seq_along(towns[, 1]), mdsfit$eig, type = 'b')
abline(h = 0)
```
Answer: I think so.

## b)

Plot the two-dimensional solution (as a 2D scatterplot) labeling each point by town name.

```{r}
plot(y[, 1],y[, 2], type = 'n')
text(y[, 1],y[, 2], labels = rownames(towns), cex = 0.5)
```

Compare with a map of England.
Do they look similar?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of british towns", out.height = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("british_towns.png")
```

This map is taken from "https://www.britain-visitor.com/images/content_images/british-isles-towns-large.gif".

# Problem 2

Consider the zoo dataset,
where 17 variables are observed on 101 animals.
Excluding the variable ``type``, the other 16 variables are categorical:
most of them are yes/no indicators,
and ``legs`` can be seen as a categorical variable too.
So, the dissimilarity between animals i and j can be defined as the number of characteristics in which they differ:
$\delta_{ij} = \#\{f : x_{ik} \neq x_{jk}\}$.
In ``R`` you can do this as follows:
``D <- matrix(nrow=101, ncol=101)
for (i in 1:101){ for (j in 1:101){ D[i, j] <- sum(x[i,]!=x[j,]) } }``

```{r}
zoo <- read.csv(file = '../Data_csv/zoo.csv')
```

```{r}
D_zoo <- matrix(nrow = 101, ncol = 101)
for (i in 1:101) { for (j in 1:101) { D_zoo[i, j] <- sum(zoo[i,] != zoo[j,]) } }
```

## a)

Carry out a two-dimensional multidimensional scaling.
Plot the resulting configuration using animal names as labels.

## b)

Try to find, if possible, an interpretation for the coordinates, in terms of anatomical or physiological characteristics of the animals.
